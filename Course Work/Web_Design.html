        <h2>Style guide</h2>

        <h3>Brand Overview</h3>

        <p>
            The Ferrari brand represents a legacy of luxury, speed, and Italian craftsmanship. This website aims to
            create an immersive experience for car enthusiasts, luxury buyers, and Ferrari aficionados. The tone of
            voice will be energetic and aspirational, capturing the passion and thrill associated with the Ferrari
            brand. Our goal is to not only showcase the cars but also to foster a community among users who share a deep
            love for these iconic vehicles.
        </p>

        <h3>Color Palette</h3>

        <p>
            The color palette will enhance the website’s aesthetic while reflecting the essence of Ferrari. The primary
            color will be Ferrari Red (#FF2800), symbolizing the brand's passion and performance. Various shades of red
            will be used to create depth and visual interest:

        <ul>
            <li>
                Primary Color: Ferrari Red (#FF2800)
            </li>
            <li>
                Dark Red: (#B22222) for highlights and backgrounds
            </li>
            <li>
                Light Red: (#FF6F61) for secondary accents
            </li>
            <li>
                Black: (#000000) for all text to ensure readability
            </li>
            <li>
                White: (#FFFFFF) for contrast and to separate sections visually
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Typography</h3>

        <p>
            Typography will play a crucial role in establishing the site’s tone. We will use Poppins, a modern
            sans-serif font that conveys elegance and clarity. This will be backed up with sans-serif to fall back on if
            Poppins is not available.
        </p>

        <h3>UI Elements</h3>

        <p>
            The user interface will be designed for intuitive navigation and visual appeal. The navigation bar will
            feature a white background with links in Black for high visibility.
        </p>

        <h3>Imagery and Graphics</h3>

        <p>
            High-quality imagery is essential to capture the essence of Ferrari. Car images will be bright and vibrant,
            showcasing the sleek design and unique features of each vehicle. A consistent aspect ratio will be
            maintained across the gallery and catalog for uniformity. For data visualizations, a Bubble Word Map will
            display car names in varying shades of red, with clear and readable bubbles. On hover, an overlay will show
            the car's image, price, name, and fuel type. A Line Graph will illustrate price trends over the past four
            years, with data points in Ferrari Red and connecting lines in Dark Red, featuring clear Black axis labels
            for easy interpretation.
        </p>

        <h3>Layout and Grid System</h3>

        <p>
            To achieve a structured and visually appealing layout, a 3-column grid system will be employed. This
            flexible design allows for easy adjustments across different screen sizes while maintaining alignment and
            spacing. Responsive design is crucial for users on various devices. On smaller screens, the navigation bar
            will collapse into a hamburger menu, ensuring a clean and accessible experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Interactive Elements</h3>

        <p>
            Interactive elements will enhance user engagement. Subtle animations will be used for buttons and links,
            providing immediate feedback during user interactions. Transition effects for images and graphs will create
            a smooth experience as users navigate through the site. On the homepage, a dynamic animation will introduce
            key aspects of the Ferrari brand, setting an exciting tone for the rest of the site.
        </p>

        <h3>Accessibility Considerations</h3>

        <p>
            To ensure the website is accessible to all users, a strong focus on color contrast will be implemented. All
            text will be legible against background colors, adhering to WCAG guidelines
        </p>
