        <h2>Style guide</h2>

        <h3>Brand Overview</h3>

        <p>
            The Ferrari brand embodies a legacy of luxury, speed, and Italian craftsmanship. This website aims to create
            an immersive experience for car enthusiasts, luxury buyers, and Ferrari aficionados. The tone of voice will
            be energetic and aspirational, evoking the passion and thrill associated with the Ferrari brand. The goal is
            to not only showcase the cars but also to cultivate a sense of community among users who share a love for
            these iconic vehicles.
        </p>

        <h3>Color Palette</h3>

        <p>
            A plan to use a color palette will enhance the website’s aesthetic and evoke the essence of Ferrari.
            The primary color, Ferrari Red (#FF2800), will dominate the design, symbolizing the brand's passion and
            performance. This vibrant red will be used for buttons, highlights, and key elements throughout the site.
            Complementing this, Dark Red (#B22222) will be used for text and backgrounds, creating depth and contrast.

            Secondary colors include Light Grey (#F7F7F7) for backgrounds, ensuring a clean and modern look, and Black
            (#000000) for text to maintain readability. White (#FFFFFF) will also be used to provide a crisp contrast on
            dark backgrounds and help separate various sections visually.
        </p>

        <h3>Typography</h3>

        <p>
            Typography will play a crucial role in establishing the site’s tone. The headings will use Montserrat, a
            modern sans-serif font that conveys strength and clarity. The sizes will vary, with H1 set at 36px for main
            titles, H2 at 28px for section headings, and H3 at 22px for subheadings. These will typically be in Black or
            Dark Red to maintain visual hierarchy.

            For body text, Open Sans will be used for its readability and versatility. The body text will be set at 16px
            and will primarily be in Dark Red to align with the overall color scheme.

            Buttons will feature Montserrat in a Medium weight at 16px, with White text on a Ferrari Red background.
            Upon hovering, buttons will transition to Dark Red, reinforcing the site’s cohesive color theme.
        </p>

        <h3>UI Elements</h3>

        <p>
            The user interface will be designed to be intuitive and visually appealing. The navigation bar, a critical
            element, will have a Ferrari Red background with links in White, ensuring high visibility. On hover, the
            links will change to a Dark Red background, providing a clear interactive cue.

            Buttons will be designed with rounded corners to evoke a sense of modernity and elegance. They will feature
            a shadow effect to give depth and draw attention. Hover effects will include a slight increase in size and a
            color shift to enhance the interactivity of the site.
        </p>

        <h3>Imagery and Graphics</h3>

        <p>
            High-quality imagery is essential for capturing the essence of Ferrari. Car images should be bright and
            vibrant, emphasizing the sleek design and unique features of each vehicle. I will need to find a consistent
            aspect ratio that will be maintained for uniformity across the gallery and catalog.

            For data visualizations, the Bubble Word Map will display car names in varying shades of red. The bubbles
            will be clear and easy to read, while on hover, an overlay will showcase the car's image, price, name, and
            fuel type.

            The Line Graph will represent price trends over the past four years, with data points in Ferrari Red and
            connecting lines in Dark Red. Clear axis labels in Black will ensure that the data is easily interpretable.
        </p>

        <h3>Layout and Grid System</h3>

        <p>
            To achieve a well-structured and visually appealing layout, a 3-column grid system will be employed. This
            flexible design allows for easy adjustments across different screen sizes while maintaining alignment and
            spacing.

            Responsive design is crucial for catering to users on various devices. All elements will be tested to ensure
            they adapt seamlessly to mobile and tablet views. On smaller screens, the navigation bar will collapse into
            a hamburger menu, providing a clean and accessible experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Interactive Elements</h3>

        <p>
            Interactive elements will enhance user engagement. Subtle animations will be used for buttons and links,
            providing feedback during user interactions. Transition effects for images and graphs will create a smooth
            experience as users navigate through the site.

            On the homepage, a catchy animation will introduce the site and draw users in. This animation should
            highlight key aspects of the Ferrari brand, setting the tone for the rest of the site.
        </p>

        <h3>Accessibility Considerations</h3>

        <p>
            To ensure that the website is accessible to all users, a strong focus on color contrast will be implemented.
            All text will be legible against background colors, adhering to WCAG guidelines. Alternative text will be
            provided for all images, making them accessible to screen readers. Furthermore, all interactive elements
            will be navigable via keyboard shortcuts, allowing for an inclusive user experience.
