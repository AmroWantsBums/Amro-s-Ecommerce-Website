        <article>
           
            <p>
                Welcome to my corner of the digital world! My name is Amro Ahmed, and I am currently a third-year student
                at the University of Witwatersrand, where I am pursuing a degree in Digital Arts with a major in Game Design
                and Interactive Media. This website is not only a project for my coursework but also a portfolio that
                showcases my passion for design and my skills in creating engaging, interactive experiences.
            </p>

            <p>
                Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in various aspects of digital art,
                including graphic design, animation, and user experience. My studies in game design have taught me how to
                blend creativity with technical expertise, allowing me to create immersive environments and captivating
                narratives. I thrive on the challenge of transforming ideas into dynamic, interactive experiences that
                resonate with users.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to my academic achievements, I have actively sought opportunities to expand my skill set outside
                the classroom. I have worked on several collaborative projects, honing my abilities in teamwork,
                communication, and problem-solving. My goal is to continue pushing the boundaries of digital design,
                exploring new technologies, and discovering innovative ways to connect with audiences.    
            </p>

            <p>
                This website features my latest project—a Ferrari-themed eCommerce platform—designed to highlight my skills
                in web design and data visualization. It reflects my love for automotive design and my commitment to
                creating user-friendly interfaces that enhance the shopping experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am excited to share my journey and work with you. Feel free to explore my projects, and don't hesitate to
                reach out if you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration!
            </p>
            
            <p>
